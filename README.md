# Christopher Vigliotti

Hi!  I’m currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at USCIS DID(it) / Evans & Chambers Technology (JavaScript, SQL Server, ColdFusion and a splash of Rails (AFT)).  

## My Résumé

[Here it is!](https://gist.github.com/christophervigliotti/bb4cd6312bd7a8459cff3412f33c71f9).  

## Other Stuff

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Angular (progress and repos [here](https://gist.github.com/christophervigliotti/92e5b3b93cbe9d630d8e9d81b7eb6636)) and am brushing up on Bootstrap (which I would love to use more) and jQuery (which I am very comfortable with but am working to fill some knowledge gaps).  Always be learning, y'all!
